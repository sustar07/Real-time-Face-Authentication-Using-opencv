# Real-time Face Authentication Using OpenCV

## Overview

This project implements a real-time face authentication system using Python, OpenCV, Flask, and MongoDB. It captures live video from a webcam, detects faces, and matches them against pre-registered faces in a MongoDB database. If a match is found, the system authenticates the user. The project can be extended to perform various tasks like attendance management, secure access control, and more.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and authentication
- Integration with MongoDB to store and retrieve user face data
- Simple Flask web interface for user registration and authentication
- Scalable architecture, can support multiple users
- Authentication with live video feed using OpenCV

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For backend programming
- **OpenCV**: For capturing and processing real-time video and face detection
- **Flask**: For creating the web application and APIs
- **MongoDB**: To store user face data (e.g., feature vectors or images)

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Flask
- MongoDB

You can install the necessary Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Real-time-Face-Authentication-Using-opencv.git
cd Real-time-Face-Authentication-Using-opencv
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up MongoDB:**

   Ensure that MongoDB is installed and running on your machine or server. The system will store face data in MongoDB for later authentication.

4. **Start the Flask server:**

```bash
python app.py
```

5. **Access the application:**

   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

## Usage

### 1. **User Registration**

   - Go to the registration page via the web interface.
   - Enter the user details and capture the face through the webcam.
   - The face data will be stored in MongoDB.

### 2. **User Authentication**

   - Go to the authentication page.
   - The system will capture a live video feed, detect your face, and authenticate against the stored face data.
   - If a match is found, the user will be successfully authenticated.

## How It Works

1. **Face Detection**: The system uses OpenCV's Haar Cascades or DNN models to detect faces from a live video stream.
2. **Face Registration**: New users are registered by capturing their face, encoding it, and saving it in the MongoDB database.
3. **Face Authentication**: The system compares the live face data with stored face data using face recognition algorithms (such as LBPH, Eigenfaces, or DNN-based models) and authenticates if a match is found.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for more face recognition models (e.g., DNN-based models for better accuracy)
- Improve the UI for better user experience
- Add multi-factor authentication (e.g., face + password)
- Implement logging and analytics
- Deploy the system on cloud platforms (AWS, Heroku, etc.)
